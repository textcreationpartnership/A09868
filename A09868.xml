            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:15369:4"/>
The Text in it ſelfe is very cleare, the ſenſe obvious and eaſie; no word, no phraſe obſcure or am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous. S. <hi>Peter</hi> had three times denied his Lord, and forſworne him: which in ſuch a prime A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, ſuch a confident Profeſſor, ſo great a zelote, <hi>(Though all ſhould denie thee, yet will not I,)</hi> was a ſin very ſhamefull, damnable, and ſcandelous. But our Lord is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite in compaſſions, and no ſinne is unpardonable to a penitent, and S. <hi>Peter</hi> had ſeriouſly and ſadly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented; <hi>Hee wept bitterly:</hi> and I doubt not his heart ble<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

               </gap> faſt as his eyes. Therefore the Lord <hi>lookes</hi> upon him with mercy; not onely pardons his fault, but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits him againe into his favour, and here by a publique ſolemne
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:15369:4"/>
act reſtores him againe to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree and dignity from which hee was falne.</p>
            <p>But before his admiſſion, his Maſter thinkes meet to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine him, and the more to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige him to his ſervice, he firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires him to give ſatisfaction for the ſcandall which hee had given, and as hee had thrice renounced him, ſo thrice againe to proteſt his ardent affection and love un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. Saint <hi>Peters</hi> fall had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken downe his pride, and taught him the vanity and feebleneſle of a ſtrong preſumption. Hee now anſwers his Maſter with no leſſe zeale, but with more modeſtie. Chriſt askes him, <hi>I oveſt thou mee more then theſe?</hi> A galling queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſecretly and ſweetly taxing his

former confidence. <hi>Peter</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands him, and humbly replyes, <hi>Lord thou knoweſt all things, thou knoweſt that I love thee.</hi> I dare ſay my love is true and ſincere, I dare not ſay it is ſtrong and ſteddie, leſt a ſecond ſlip confute and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray me. And having thrice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated this proteſtation (and ſo often recanted his former deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all) our Lord honors him a new with his ancient charge, puts him againe in his commiſſion, and for his comfort here thrice repeats it: <hi>If thou loveſt me,</hi> (and as thou loveſt me,) <hi>Feed my I ambes feed my ſheepe, feed my ſheepe.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>This is the plaine and proper and native meaning of the words; and thus the ancient <hi>Catholike</hi> Church for many ages, without ſeruple or queſtion, made this and no other conſtruction of my Text. For thoſe worthies of the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:15369:7"/>
               <hi>Primitive</hi> times were wont to bring onely learning and a good conſcience to the expounding of Scripture, laying aſide all paſſion and priuate intereſt; and they were content to take ſuch a ſenſe as the holy Text offered, not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to bring or make a new ſenſe of their owne, ſuch as might ſuit w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> their deſire or fantaſie. But the following Ages loſt by degrees firſt conſcience, then learning, and at length all modeſty.</p>
            <p>The firſt <hi>Biſhops</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> for many yeares, good ſoules, thought more of their <hi>Martyrdome</hi> then of any <hi>Monarchy.</hi> They truly ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Peter,</hi> in his holineſſe, in his fidelity, in his humility; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued this precept from <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Maſter plainly, as he intended it,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:15369:7"/>
and with an honeſt ſimple mind accordingly applied themſelves to <hi>feed his ſheepe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After a while, when the warme favour of the times had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what kindled their hopes and ambition, though they began to nouriſh great and boundleſſe thoughts, and had an itching de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to inlarge their fringes; yet at firſt they were reaſonably mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in their pretenſions: partly out of their owne ingenuity (for they loſt not all ſhame at once;) and partly by reaſon of that ſtout and free oppoſition which upon any attempt or invaſion, they found in the <hi>Eaſterne</hi> and <hi>Africane</hi> Churches, which began quickly to be jealous of <hi>Romes</hi> growing greatneſſe. They claimed onely a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:15369:8"/>
               <hi>precedency</hi> or a <hi>primacy,</hi> not any <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy,</hi> a primacy of order, or at moſt of honour, not of power, <hi>among</hi> their Brethren, not <hi>over</hi> them: Some conteſtations they had with Biſhops, none with Emperors. For they medled yet onely with the keyes, not with the ſwords; and confeſſed all the power they had or challenged, to be meerely purely ſpirituall, for the conduct and benefit of ſoules: nothing at all directly or indirect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly temporall. And to fortifie all this claime, whatſoever it was, they were content to found it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the majeſtie of their Sea, being the peerleſſe <hi>Imperiall</hi> Citie, upon the Charters and Patents of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, upon the pietie and ſound faith of their Predeceſſors, upon
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:15369:8"/>
the generall and juſt conſent of Chriſtendome, which had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned them a prime place among other Patriarches, in all Synods and Aſſemblies. But their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads were yet too ſoft to plead any Scriptures for their pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or to derive their primacy from divine inſtitution.

            <p>I need not tell you what good ſtuffe theſe good wits have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted out of thoſe other words, <hi>Dabo tibi claves,</hi> and <hi>Oravi pro te, Petre:</hi> not to goe farre, my Text is a moſt memorable example of their ſingular wit and dexteritie in abuſing of Scripture. <hi>Mirth</hi> is unſeaſonable in diſcourſes of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and for a Chriſtian to laugh at blaſphemy is to approve it: it beſeemes him much better to lament it with teares of bloud. My Text, I confeſſe, is very rich
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:15369:13"/>
and plentifull in the ſenſe, and (as by and by we ſhall ſee) will rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily offer us much excellent mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Chriſtian meditation and diſcourſe. But the collections which they of the Popes ſide have drawne from hence, are ſuch and ſo frivolous, that they are much more <hi>capable</hi> to move the ſpleene (if the gravitie of the matter per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted) then the judgement; and are more properly confuted with a ſmile, then with any ſtrength of reaſon.</p>
            <p>Here is one word in the Text <hi>paſce</hi> which the Cardinall <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> hath ſo extended between his teeth, that it hath a belly as large and fruitfull as the <hi>Trojane</hi> horſe, including whole armies of arguments for the Pope. The
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:15369:13"/>
Pope can deſire nothing which this word will not give him. He pretends to be a <hi>King</hi> as well as a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> and ſayes his temporall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer is as wide and broad as his ſpirituall. And tis true, ſayes <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine,</hi> for Chriſt ſaid to S. <hi>Peter, Paſce, id eſt, Regio more impera;</hi> play the <hi>Rex.</hi> In the ancient Church when any hereſie diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed the publique truth and peace, a grave aſſembly of Biſhops was called, and the Booke of God fairly laid open in the midſt, and out of it were all doubts determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Now, Scriptures and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cills are needleſſe: for the Pope claimes to be ſupreame Iudge of all Controverſies. And <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 4. de Rom. P. cap. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> thinkes the claime to be well grounded upon this <hi>paſce</hi> in my
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:15369:14"/>

Briefly, this one word containes more matter then al the Bible beſides: it works miracles, and makes the Pope om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent; gives him all power not onely in heaven and earth, but (where God hath nothing to doe) in Purgatorie. For if you aske, by what authoritie he takes
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:15369:14"/>
upon him to pardon ſinnes and ſoules after death, to give or ſell the Saints merits, to diſpenſe with oathes, to depoſe Kings and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of their kingdomes, or if he liſt, to murther them:—If you looke into the Popes <hi>Lexicon,</hi> you ſhall find that <hi>paſce</hi> expreſſely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes all this authoritie, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables him to be not only a <hi>Prince,</hi> or a <hi>Paſtor,</hi> or a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> but even a <hi>Butcher.</hi>

            <p>For the firſt: <hi>Peter</hi> takes not upon himſelfe the honor of the Apoſtleſhip, till he was called by Chriſt his Lord and God, as were the reſt of his fellowes. In that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:15369:16"/>
calling of the Apoſtles, ſome things were perſonall and peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar to themſelves, others generall, concerning all their lawfull Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, Biſhops and Paſtors. The Apoſtles had an <hi>immediate</hi> voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Chriſt in perſon: our calling is not <hi>of</hi> men, but tis <hi>by</hi> men: theirs neither of men nor by men. They had an <hi>univerſall</hi> miſſion, an unlimited juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, an infallible aſſiſtance of the Spirit, the gift of tongues and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles. All theſe were <hi>priviledges</hi> extraordinarie, and paſſed with their perſons. But the warrant and worke of this Commiſſion generally and equally belongs to all us, as well as to all them: None may uſurpe the charge of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop or a Paſtor, till <hi>Ieſus ſay unto
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:15369:16"/>
him, Feed my ſheepe.</hi> And hence we learne two leſlons of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance and conſideration.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Author of all lawfull <note place="margin">1</note> vocation to the holy Miniſterie, is onely <hi>Chriſt the Lord.</hi> Onely Chriſt, excluſively to all men, not to the two other <hi>Perſons</hi> in the glorious Trinity, which all equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concur to this externall worke. God the <hi>Father</hi> hath placed in the Church, <note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 28.</note> 
               <hi>Apoſtles, Prophets, Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, Paſtors, &amp;c.</hi> And God the <note n="b" place="margin">Act. 20. 28.</note> 
               <hi>holy Ghoſt ordained</hi> the Biſhops at <hi>Epheſus;</hi> and elſewhere, <note n="c" place="margin">Act. 1 3. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Separate me Paul and Barnabas for the worke whereunto I have called them.</hi> For it belongs onely to the <note n="d" place="margin">Mat. 9. 38.</note> 
               <hi>Lord of the harveſt to ſend forth labourers into his harveſt:</hi> and who ſhould appoint <note n="e" place="margin">Mat. 24. 45.</note> 
               <hi>Stewards over the Houſe,</hi> but he
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:15369:17"/>
who is Maſter of the Houſe, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the family?</p>
            <p>This conſideration muſt firſt helpe to animate our feebleneſſe, and add unto us an edge and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage againſt all the difficulties and diſcouragements, which we ſhall meet in our holy calling. Everie good Miniſter muſt looke to bee <hi>Theologus crucis,</hi> not <hi>Theologus glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riae:</hi> when hee enters upon this warfare, hee may not dreame of an eaſie or lazie life, to paſſe his time in pompe or pleaſure, like the glorious <hi>Clergie</hi> of Rome: but he muſt prepare to play the man, and fight it out, not onely with abſurd and unreaſonable men, but even with beaſts, as <hi>Paul</hi> did at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> yea with devills. And therefore he muſt buckle himſelfe
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:15369:17"/>
to his worke, and know that hee muſt eate his bread, if not with the ſweating of his browes, yet (which is much ſorer) with the beating of his braines. Wherefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> wanting a word able to expreſſe the grievous paines of our Miniſtery, ſets it forth in two, both very ſore and heavie ones: Our calling is <note n="a" place="margin">1 Theſſ. 2. 9 and 2 Theſſ. 3. 8</note>

And hence in Scripture are Miniſters ſo often compared to <hi>Souldiers, Shepheards, Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Nurſes,—</hi>all callings of little eaſe: and ſure the paſtorall toyle in the cure of ſoules is no leſſe then was <note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 31. 40.</note>

               <hi>Hee will give us a mouth and wiſedome, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which none of our adverſaries ſhall be able to reſiſt:</hi> and his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſhall make the Goſpel in our mouthes the arme of the Lord,

            <p>Againe, ſeeing it is Chriſt who hath put us in this Commiſſion, and ſends us upon his errand; this muſt quicken us to a ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous care, a conſtant diligence and vigilance in our holy vocation.

A holy vocation is neceſſary to a holy function. Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe ſubmitted himſelfe to this rule; He preached not till he was ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly ordained by a voice from heaven, he tooke not upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe the honour, till his Father called him.</p>
            <p>Now the calling neceſſary to every lawfull Paſtor at this day, is twofold; one <hi>inward</hi> from God, the other <hi>outward</hi> by the Church.</p>
            <p>The <hi>inward</hi> calling is that wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God touches the heart of a man with a holy deſire to conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate himſelfe to the ſervice of his
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:15369:21"/>
               <hi>Houſe,</hi> and inables him by his grace to edifie his Church by word and worke. The princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall evidences of this calling are two. 1. The teſtimony of a mans conſcience, that he enters not into holy Orders for any carnall by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpect, but onely or chiefly to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God by his labours. And 2. a tollerable competent meaſure of learning, piety, zeale, diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wiſedome, eloquence, and ſuch other gifts requiſite for the diſcharge of ſo high an office. Gods ſending and gifting goe ſtill together. He is not wont to ſend unto his people any <hi>headleſſe</hi> or <hi>heartleſſe</hi> Meſſengers; His calling either findes us or makes us fit for his ſervice. A Miniſter groſſely ignorant, or ſcandalouſly profane
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:15369:22"/>
goes upon his owne errand, hee may be ſure God never ſent him; He never imployes ſuch unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie Ambaſſadors.

Many that cannot thrive in any other courſe of life, when they are dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to their laſt hopes and extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, at laſt ſhift themſelves into the coat and calling of Miniſters, and he that knowes himſelfe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit in any other imployment to ſerve men, yet thinkes himſelfe fit enough to ſerve God in this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred calling. All theſe intruders and mercenaries ſhall bee ſure to faile of their hopes, and ſhall one

            <p>Now beſides this inward cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling which ſerves onely to ſettle our owne conſcience; it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that the Church doe <hi>external<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> call and inſtall us by ſome pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique ſolemnitie, before we may adventure upon the exerciſe of this holy function. After grave and due examination of our life and learning, if the Church of God do approve us, if by the hands of ſuch as are in authoritie ſhee ordaine and admit us; then may we law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and ſafely enter upon this holy charge, not otherwiſe.</p>

But that vocation which the <hi>Romiſh Prieſts</hi> abuſed to the diſhonour of God,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:15369:24"/>
and the ſuppreſſing of his truth, our Reformers (according to their dutie and conſcience) uſed for the reeſtabliſhing of pure doctrine. Thus <hi>Wiclif, Hus, Luther, Zuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glius, Oecolampadius, Bucer, Martyr, &amp;c.</hi> the firſt purgers of the Church fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Roman ſuperſtition &amp; tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, were al created &amp; ordained by the Church of Rome it ſelfe, <hi>Prieſts</hi> or <hi>Doctors</hi> of Divinitie, by an ordinary, uſuall, publique vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and that with a ſolemne adjuration, that they ſhould duly and diligently teach the truth of God in his Church according to his word.

Rome, (not by her authority) yet we both avouch our vocation to be holy and lawfull, and chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge theirs to be ſacrilegious. For in the Romane Prieſthood are confuſedly intermingled things holy and profane; it is partly a Roſe, partly a Nettle; it conſiſts of a double power, one ſacred, to abſolve ſinners by the Miniſtery of reconciliation, which we em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace and retaine; the other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious to ſacrifice againe Chriſt Ieſus in the Maſſe, which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and abominate.

Onely thus much I cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare: Our deare <hi>Soveraigne,</hi> his gracious Maſter, hath honoured not Him ſo much, as Himſelfe and the Age, in the freedome of his noble and unexpected choice.

Friends, yet) hee owes it to no thing, to no man, but to God and the King. And thus ſhall it bee done to all them which truly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God and the King; God and the King without doubt will honour them.</p>
            <p>Thus at length we have done with the firſt part of the Text, the authority of <hi>Peters</hi> commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>Ieſus ſaid unto him;</hi> the next now followes, expreſſing the matter or ſum of it, <hi>Feed my ſheepe.</hi> A rich and copious argument, wherein it were eaſie to be end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe.

firſt valour to keep off the thiefe, the Wolfe, the Fox, and all rave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous beaſts. Secondly, wiſdome, to keepe all his flocke within the pale of good order; and if any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly diſorderly Ramme will bee ranging, to curbe and call him in with his whiſtle if he can, or if not, with his crooke. Thirdly, fidelity, to provide his lambs and ſheepe of wholſome convenient paſture.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſame <hi>cares</hi> and <hi>vertues,</hi> in proportion, are required in all ſpirituall Paſtors, ſpecially and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently in every good Biſhop.</p>

A thing that was never of Gods making, created onely by the Pope: and yet though he owes his being to the Pope, (and the Pope againe reciprocally his being now to him,) and would ſeeme to honor him whoſe name hee leudly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes, yet the truth is (as that pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent French Cardinall <hi>d'Oſſat,</hi> wel <note place="margin">Epiſtre 8. a Monſ Villi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey.</note> obſerving the <hi>maximes</hi> of the <hi>Ieſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itical Cabale,</hi> &amp; their practiſes, long ſince rightly defined him) <hi>A Ieſuite</hi>

            <p>But 3. the prime care and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of a good Biſhop is faithfully
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:15369:31"/>
and fruitfully to diſpenſe the word of life, the doctrine of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to his people; and to live himſelfe the life which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends: that ſo he may be an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute paterne of pietie, and his life a cleare commentary upon his doctrine. This I call his <hi>prime care</hi> and vertue; for tis this which our Lord principally intends in this charge to <hi>Peter</hi> and all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, <hi>Feed my ſheepe:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here wee will inſiſt a little.

But I meane the plaine preaching of that <hi>truth</hi> which is <hi>according unto godlineſſe,</hi> the laying of the <hi>foundation</hi> of faith in Chriſt, and <hi>repentance from dead workes,</hi> and new obedience. Which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever now adayes we put off to our <hi>Curates</hi> and under-journey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as a thing unbeſeeming our learning and greatneſſe; yet Saint <hi>Paul</hi> is of another judgement, and accounts this the <hi>maſter-piece</hi> of a <hi>wiſe Architect.</hi> And ſure (that <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 10</note> I may borrow the words of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Prelate of this Church) the <note place="margin">D.

Whoſe heart (that hath any compaſſion) bleeds not to ſee the ſtrange growth of ignorance and infidelity in this age, and the poor Church every where miſerably labouring under her wofull <hi>Schiſmes</hi> and ruptures! Certainly, the ground of all this calamity is, becauſe the old rudiments of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, the <hi>principles</hi> of ſaving truth are every where neglected, and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:15369:32"/>
new ſubtle inventions with great vehemency preſſed.

But no doubt the good people of God took onely the milk, left the poiſon; received the bread, rejected the leaven; fed heartily upon the plaine word of grace and mercy by Chriſt, &amp; ſcantly touched the new diſhes &amp; devices of Rome, which (by Gods eſpeciall provide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce) were of ſo hard digeſtion, of ſuch a high and ſubtle ſtrain, that vulgar ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities could not reach them, and ſo could not be poiſoned by them.</p>
            <p>Againe, a ſheepe is a creature not more ſimple then innocent: And to this end muſt all our labors with our People, all their endeavors aime, that they may be at length preſented as a flock of harmleſs <hi>ſheepe</hi> to the imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate <hi>I amb</hi> of God, the ſoverain <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor.</hi> Otherwiſe he wil not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for his.

                  <hi>Gregory</hi> 2. having commantled <hi>Alphonſus</hi> King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> that lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the office of the <hi>Mozarabes</hi> he receive that of <hi>Rome, Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> 3. writeth <hi>lib 9. epiſt.</hi> 2. that it was accordingly received: yet all the Hiſtorians of <hi>Spaine</hi> do agree, that the King would never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure any alteration in this office, nor admit the Romane. In <hi>Cap. 1. de poſtul. Praelatorum.

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:15369:48"/>
or to approve the pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Pope.</hi> I will further add, that many times when ſuch Bulls have beene publiſhed under the name of the Popes, they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have beene conſtrained af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to deny them, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe them to have beene extorted. <hi>Adrian</hi> the 2. <hi>anno</hi> 870. ſent a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere <hi>Monitorie</hi> to <hi>Charles the Bald</hi> K. of <hi>France,</hi> commanding him to forbeare to ſeize upon the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Lotharius</hi> his deceaſed Nephew, and to the ſame effect writing his Letters to the Prelates and Nobilitie of the Realme. The King nevertheleſſe proſecuting his purpoſes, anſwered the <hi>Pope</hi> with freedome and bitterneſſe. Wherefore his Holineſſe in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to the King, firſt amply com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:15369:49"/>
the Royall vertues where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he heard that he was ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, then teſtifies his great good will towards him, and concludes that if hee had formerly received from him any Letters of another tenor, or of a more hard or ſharp or rough ſtile, hee prayes him to beleeve that he was ſurpriſed, and that they were ſtollen from him unawares, or when he was ſick, or happely counterfaited.</p>
               <p>The Lawyers doe all conſent, that no man can prove himſelfe to have Iuriſdiction over another by ſhowing a Citation, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, or Sentence, unleſſe he can ſhow that the Citation was inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, and the Decree obeyed, and the ſentence put in execution. Be it that the <hi>Pope</hi> did diſpatch
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:15369:49"/>
this Breve in queſtion unto the <hi>Cardinall</hi> of <hi>Ioyeuſe,</hi> (which I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beleeve, nor deny,) yet ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was here never ſeene, either by the <hi>Prince,</hi> or by any publike Miniſter, nor even by any private perſon of this <hi>State,</hi> (ſo far as that is knowne) what ever it contain, that cannot bee any prejudice to the Reaſons and Rights of this <hi>Republique.</hi> And if any will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to found or inferre ought upon this <hi>Breve,</hi> it belongs to him to make proofe that it was recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, or elſe preſented, or finally at leaſt ſeene or known or brought to ſome mans notice; nothing of which is true in this whereof we ſpeake. And if in time to come any <hi>Breve</hi> be fained or produced of what tenor ſoever, it ought not
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:15369:50"/>
to prevaile againſt the faith and teſtimony of true hiſtories, which will beare witneſſe to Poſterity that no Breve at all paſſed in this action. Wherefore it remaines onely to be conſidered, what the <hi>Cardinall</hi> hath done or executed.</p>
               <p>Concerning which, there is <note place="margin">2</note> diſperſed a certaine Inſtrument of one <hi>Paul Catel</hi> an <hi>Apoſtolique Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonotary,</hi> wherein (to give more credit to the forgery) are named particularly 6 Counſellors, 3 of the chiefe of the Councell of 40, and 16 Sages: which affirmeth, that the <hi>Cardinal</hi> did abſolve them from the Excommunication, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing penance upon them at the pleaſure of their Confeſſor, and that the Duke, the Counſellers, and Sages aforeſaid did humbly
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:15369:50"/>
receive it: in the preſence of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur de Freſne,</hi> and <hi>Peter Poſier Sieur de la Paume.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this particular, any perſon may eaſily diſcerne (by the ſole evidence of the fact knowne to all the world, and more cleare then the Sun at mid-day,) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Republique</hi> hath deſired or received Abſolution, as the ſaid Inſtrument doth falſely ſuggeſt; or rather hath alwayes conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſiſted in defence of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, which had no need of any Abſolution. It is a caſe evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent out of the Word of God, that the Church hath no autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to remit the ſinnes of any, or to grant Abſolution to any, ſave onely to ſuch as are penitent: But in the opinion of all <hi>Divines</hi> and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:15369:51"/>
                  <hi>Canoniſts</hi> there is not the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>Cenſures,</hi> from which (as they jointly affirme) one may be abſolved though hee doe not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, though he demand it not, yea though he reſiſt and refuſe to accept abſolution. This hath bin done by ſome Popes of Rome, and one memorable example we have in <hi>Philip le Bel</hi> K. of <hi>France,</hi> who impriſoned the Biſhop of <hi>Rimini</hi> for ſome bold words and commandements, which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in the name of Pope <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niface</hi> 8. Whereupon the Pope ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated him, in the yeare 1300, and the yeare following 1301 thundred out another Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication together with an Interdict, becauſe the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to acknowledge him for
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:15369:51"/>
his temporall Superiour; and the heat of theſe matters paſſed ſo far, that the King chaſed out of <hi>France</hi> the <hi>Archdeacon</hi> of <hi>Narbon</hi> the <hi>Popes</hi> Nuncio, and caſt the Popes Bull publiquely into the fire: and this Controverſie continued till the yeare 1303: when the Pope ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out a third Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt <hi>Philip,</hi> the King ſent to <hi>Anagni</hi> (where then the Pope was) <hi>Monſ de Negaret,</hi> who (with the <hi>Colonneſi</hi> and ſome others) there tooke the Pope priſoner, who died after ſome few dayes. The King never ſought after any abſolution from the former Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, but notwithſtanding, <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict</hi> 11. (who ſucceeded <hi>Boniface)</hi> in the ſame yeare 1303, abſolved the King from them, making ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:15369:52"/>
mention in his Bull, that the King had not required it. All this is recorded by the Hiſtorians of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England.</hi> This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour of the king did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from pride or any evil mind, but from the conſcience of his innocency: In teſtimony where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Clement 5 anno</hi> 1305 declared in Conſiſtory, that all which the King had done againſt <hi>Boniface</hi> was done with a good intention, and afterwards 1311 in the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councell of <hi>Vienna,</hi> the Councell and the Pope made de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration that the cenſures fulmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated by <hi>Boniface</hi> againſt the king were unjuſt.</p>
               <p>It remaines therefore a thing apparent and manifeſt, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though commonly ſuch are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoiled
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:15369:52"/>
from Cenſures, as doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> themſelves rightly cenſured, and being ſory for their faults require penance and abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yet ſometimes the Prelate himſelfe, who hath unduly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in his Cenſures againſt an innocent, for his owne reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or ſome other cauſe may give him abſolution though he deſire it not, nay though he openly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt that hee hath no need of it. Now our falſe <hi>Paul Catel</hi> preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth that the <hi>Cardinall de Ioyeuſe</hi> did abſolve the Duke and the Colledge: But did they demand it! or did he require them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe their fault, or aſſoile them upon their petition? This he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay; for the Prince and Senate having from the beginning pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:15369:53"/>
to eſteeme the Popes Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures as null, and commanded that his Interdict (as null in like manner) ſhould not be obſerved, they never after altered their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and reſolution. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Divine Service was ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued both in <hi>Venice</hi> &amp; through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the State. Yea that very mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>April</hi> 21, (being the day of the pretended Abſolution) Maſſe and other divine Offices were celebrated (as they are wont) throughout all the City, and in all the Cities of the <hi>Signory,</hi> and that ſame morning (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the cuſtome of other daies) the Prince together with the Colledge heard Maſſe in his Chappell, before the comming of the <hi>Cardinall.</hi> Wherefore the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:15369:53"/>
hath never acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged any error committed, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from their firſt deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. If they had, it had beene meet at leaſt that they ſhould correct their error, if not doe penance. And the Eccleſiaſtiques are ſo cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in the proclaiming of their Rights and Conqueſts, that when any one repents and craves their Abſolution, they are wont to make thereof publique demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations, cautions for the time to come, and the like things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with their Decretals are full, and many ſuch examples recorded in Hiſtories, which cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied or blamed by them who have confeſſed their fault and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked pardon. Seeing therefore it is true and notorious to all the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:15369:54"/>
world, that this pretended Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict was not obſerved for one moment; what man can bee ſo fooliſh and ſimple, as to beleeve that the State hath any whit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented? But if they ſay, that Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution was given to the Colledge without their conſent, who could hinder them to doe it in ſuch a faſhion? Abſolution from Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures may be thus given to him that is willing, and to him that is unwilling, as well in abſence as in preſence, either with words, or after any other manner. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they may make ſhort and tell us, that the <hi>Cardinall</hi> in his lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, or in his Barge hath given this ſolemne Abſolution: for who can deny it? they ſay no more in effect, when they ſay
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:15369:54"/>
that he did ſecretly under his hood make the ſigne of the Croſſe, which ſerved for an Abſolution; if he did ſo, who could hinder him?</p>
               <p>It is true, the <hi>Cardinall</hi> had a deſigne to give Abſolution, if he could have prevailed: And he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted much to this end, but alwayes without ſucceſſe, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Senates conſtancy, who ever refuſed it as being well aſſured of their innocency. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being prevented, hee endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored to doe ſome action in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique which might cary ſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parence of a Benediction or an Abſolution. And to this purpoſe, firſt he deſired that he might ſay Maſſe unto the <hi>Prince,</hi> then that hee might accompany him to
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:15369:55"/>
Maſſe in the Church: But being not able to obtaine his conſent to either of theſe, he deſired him to receive at leaſt his Benediction (as we have <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Hiſt. lib. 7. pag.</hi> 415.</note> ſaid) alledging that the Apoſtolique Benediction ought not at any time to be refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. To which when it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, that verily it ought not in other caſes, when it gave no ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition of a fault confeſſed, but it ought in this where it might che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh ſuch a ſuſpition: though the <hi>Cardinall</hi> (either as he walked, or ſitting in the Colledge with the Senators,) did make a Croſſe under his Hood, yet no man can hence argue that Abſolution was received, no more then hee can draw the like concluſion from a thouſand Croſſes which the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:15369:55"/>
might have made in his Lodging, or in his Barge, or elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. But what kinde of Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution was that, whereof 22 per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons named whileſt the Cardinall was in the Colledge, not any one aroſe from his ſeat, or tooke his bonet from his head? what ſigne did there appeare of receiving ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution? Adde hereunto, that the Pope in his Breve excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated the Duke, the Senate, and their Adherents: it was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie then to abſolve all theſe. The counterfait <hi>Paul Catel</hi> ſaith, that the Colledge repreſented them all. But where were the Letters of Procuration? where will he find this repreſentation? On other like occaſions, when a Community is aſſoiled, they are carefull at
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:15369:56"/>
                  <hi>Rome</hi> to have their Inſtrument of Procuration regiſtred. They may remember that <hi>anno</hi> 1606 they did imprint at Rome the Procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory Letters of them who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented the <hi>Republique</hi> to Pope <hi>Clement</hi> 5. and three other Procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of them who repreſented it to Pope <hi>Iulius:</hi> But now they pretend that all the Senate was abſolved in ſome perſons, to whom they gave no ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date or commiſſion. This is a paſſage well beſeeming their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency and learning in the Lawes.</p>
               <p>But by one cleare and briefe reaſon we may diſpell all doubt, and convince theſe falſaries. In the <note place="margin">

writing made, preſented, or inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated either by the <hi>Pope,</hi> or by the Republique, or by their Miniſters as all confeſſe; ſaving onely the Prince his Letters to the Prelates of the State, publiſhed 21 April, and delivered the ſame day to the <hi>Cardinall de Ioycuſe,</hi> and by him received and ſent unto the Pope: In which was ſaid, that <hi>By the grace of God, a meanes was found,</hi>

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:15369:57"/>
ſurely reſt well ſatisfied that the Prince and Senate have ever diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed any error or treſpaſſe, and did profeſſe ſo much to the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall</hi> in writing, in that very point of time wherein <hi>Catel</hi> fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them to have received Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution.</p>
               <p>Much more might be ſaid in confirmation of this truth; but what hath beene ſpoken may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly ſuffice. Yet wee will a little further diſcover the forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ie of this Inſtrument, by ſome other circumſtances. The <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall de Ioyeuſe</hi> comming that morning, was met by the Prince (accompanied with the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) at the ſtaires of his Lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, and conducted by a private paſſage into the Hall of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:15369:57"/>
where the Secretaries enter firſt, then followed the Prince, and with him the <hi>Cardinal,</hi> whoſe traine was caried by one of his Servants; after them <hi>Monſieur de Freſne,</hi> and then the Senators. And being come to their ordinary ſeats, each one tooke his place, and the Traine-bearer went out. Then the <hi>Cardinall</hi> ſpoke accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the written tenor. Where were then <hi>Paul Catel</hi> and <hi>Peter Poſier,</hi> the one a Notary, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a witneſſe? Certainly both were not preſent, but one of them it may be, which bare the Traine of the <hi>Cardinall:</hi> See here, the firſt falſitie. But when did the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall</hi> give that Abſolution? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſate downe, or after? If before, verily he might give ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:15369:58"/>
ſuch Abſolutions, as we ſaid before, in his way, or in his Barge, before he came to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, or even in his Lodging, which might be as effectuall. It is a thing knowne to the <hi>Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts,</hi> that Abſolution may be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to one that ſeekes it not as well in his abſence, as if he were preſent. But if they ſay, that it was no ambulatory Abſolution, but done in the Colledge after they were ſet, where were then <hi>Paul Catel</hi> and <hi>Peter Poſier?</hi> ſince none remained there ſave onely <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur de Freſne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To bee ſhort, the world can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be deluded. Either they have abſolved the Republique upon their requeſt, or againſt their will. If they confeſſe this Abſolution

to have paſſed on them againſt their will, to what end doe they buſie themſelves to forge wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings and Atteſtations for a thing which might be done in a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand faſhions? Which practiſes as they are in their power, ſo can they not any wayes prejudice the innocence of the <hi>Republique,</hi> nor derogate from their rights. But if they pretend that the Abſolution was received and deſired by the <hi>Republique,</hi> let them forge as many writings as they pleaſe, yet ſhall they be all convicted by this, that the <hi>Interdict</hi> hath not beene ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for any one moment of time, as alſo manifeſtly appeareth by the Letters of the <hi>Prince,</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, imprinted and received by the <hi>Cardinall.</hi>

Now touching that Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">3</note> of the delivery of the priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, it is no wonder that wee have <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Hiſter. pag.</hi> 422.</note> before related, how <hi>Marc Ottobon</hi> Secretary of the State re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired an Inſtrument or act to be made by <hi>Hieronimo Polverin</hi> and <hi>Iohn Rizzard</hi> the Dukes Nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, containing, that hee <hi>Ottobon</hi> had conſigned the Priſoners to <hi>Monſieur de Freſne</hi> in gratification of the moſt Chriſtian King, with proteſtation not to prejudice here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the authority which the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique</hi> hath in judging the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtiques. For now quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, on the other ſide, they have divulged abroad the abridgement of a certaine Inſtrument, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the foreſaid <hi>Paul Catel</hi> Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolique Protonotary doth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:15369:59"/>
that <hi>Marc Ottobon</hi> the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary and <hi>Iohn Moretto</hi> Captaine Major have conſigned the ſame into the hands of <hi>Claudio Montano</hi> a Miniſter of the Popes, without proteſtation, condition, or any reſervation. About the yeare 1185 in <hi>Verona</hi> fell out a controverſie betweene <hi>Lucius 3 Pope,</hi> and the Emperour <hi>Frederic</hi> 1. about the patrimony of the Counteſſe <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilde,</hi> which both of them preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to belong unto himſelfe; The Pope pleaded that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſe had bequeathed it unto the Church, and the Emperor that ſhe did conferre it upon the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and both parties produced writings, in authentique forme as from the Counteſſe who was dead 76 yeares before. By reaſon
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:15369:60"/>
of which contradiction, the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference could not be determined, the Pope perſiſting on the one ſide, and the Emperour on the other, and each grounding his claime upon their contrary wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings. But in the occaſion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of wee ſpeake, not ſo much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the memory thereof is freſh as becauſe the reaſons are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, it will bee an eaſie matter to diſcerne the truth.</p>
               <p>And firſt for the fact it ſelfe, the <hi>Republique</hi> in the cauſe of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners hath not had any Treaty at all with the Pope, or with any of his Miniſters; but onely reſolved to give them to the moſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an King by way of gratification. Now by this donation no man can pretend, that any prejudice
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:15369:60"/>
was done to their Rights and Authority; ſince, howſoever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards the moſt Chriſtian king diſpoſed of the priſoners, that did not any way appe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>taine to the <hi>Signiory.</hi> And therefore the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary required notice to bee taken onely of his delivering them to <hi>Monſieur de Freſne,</hi> it no way im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting him what the ſaid Lord ſhould after doe with thoſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners. Though hee ſaw when the ſaid Ambaſſadour conſigned them to one there preſent, who touched them; yet he judged not fit for him to enter hereupon into any act, and therefore he did not interpoſe one word in any ſort. Wherefore a true Narrator of this action, ought not to ſay, that <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tobon</hi> delivered the priſoners into
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:15369:61"/>
the hands of <hi>Claudio Montano,</hi> without proteſtation, condition, or any reſervation; but that <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur de Freſne</hi> delivered them in preſence of <hi>Marc Ottobon,</hi> he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſilent. And this much be ſaid touching the verity of theſe two forenamed contrary Inſtruments, which as they are very different in the ſubſtance, ſo are they no leſſe diverſe in their lawfull form. For in the one is obſerved all that which is needfull for a legall va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity; and the other is defective in things eſſentiall. All Lawyers agree, that to the framing of an Inſtrument, muſt be preſuppoſed the perſon of a Notary, created by the lawfull authoritie of the Soveraigne in that place where it is to bee framed, and for the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:15369:61"/>
forme it is neceſſary that he bee acknowledged for ſuch by both the parties, and required by them both, or at leaſt by one of them, according as he hath intereſt.</p>
               <p>Now in our caſe, the priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners being preſented to <hi>Monſieur de Freſne</hi> by <hi>Marc Ottobon,</hi> who ſpake in the name of the <hi>Senate</hi> unto the Ambaſſador, both hee himſelfe and the other two No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries of the <hi>Duke,</hi> are lawfull and publique Notaries of <hi>Venice,</hi> The Secretary alone was he, who, in all that number of perſons which were preſent at the conſigning of the priſoners, had intereſt in that action: and therefore hee might lawfully require the Notaries to doe their duty. But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, who is this <hi>Paul Catel,</hi> that
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:15369:62"/>
he ſhould come to draw an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument at <hi>Venice,</hi> where he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne? If it be anſwered, that he is an Apoſtolique Protonota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and therefore hath power to forme Inſtruments concerning Eccleſiaſtiques: to paſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e by that power which we will not now diſpute, though it were not hard to ſhow that this univerſall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition ſtands in need of many limitations to make it true: But not to touch now upon that point, in the caſe whereof wee ſpeake, one of the parties was <hi>Claudio Montano,</hi> and the other <hi>Marc Ottobon</hi> and <hi>Iohn Moretto.</hi> Since then a Notary ought to be one acknowledged by them both, he could not be <hi>Paul Catel,</hi> whom one of the parties did not
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:15369:62"/>
know at all. Againe, it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that a Notary be required to doe his part, either by both the parties, or at leaſt by one of them in the preſence of the other, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the act is invalide. Now will they have the boldneſſe to ſay that <hi>Paul Catel</hi> was required by either of them? For although that <hi>Marc Ottobon</hi> was preſent when <hi>Monſieur de Freſne</hi> ſaid unto the <hi>Cardinall, Theſe are the priſoners,</hi> and when <hi>Claudio Montano</hi> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, and prayed the Officers of Iuſtice to keepe them, <hi>Ottobon</hi> himſelfe being all this while ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent: Yet it was not therefore lawfull for <hi>Paul Catel</hi> to retire himſelfe, to make an Inſtrument, and to ſay that <hi>Marc Ottobon</hi> did actually deliver the priſoners
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:15369:63"/>
without proteſtation, condition, or reſervation; but it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that <hi>Claudio Montano</hi> at leaſt ſhould have deſired the Notary to make a publique Inſtrument to this effect, that when <hi>Marc Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon</hi> had heard him deſired to make an Inſtrument, and thereby knowne him to be a Notary, and having occaſion to ſpeake, yet notwithſtanding kept ſilence, in this caſe a Notary might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded his ſilence, but hee could not ſay that he delivered the priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to <hi>Montano,</hi> that being an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth. I wiſh theſe prudent men would take leaſure to conſider, whether reaſon of Government doe permit unto them, that a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie being in an Aſſembly where ſome action paſſeth, ſhould pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:15369:63"/>
withdraw himſelfe, and without the knowledge of one partie forme an Inſtrument: this conſidered, if they will not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble with their owne conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, they muſt confeſſe that they have divulged an untruth, and a nullitie.</p>
               <p>The following actions of the State will give yet more light and atteſtation to the truth. For in the very yeare 1607, and alſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, many Eccleſiaſticall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, both Prieſts and Friers, were impriſoned, impleaded, and (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their merit) abſolved or puniſhed: Some for their ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions chaſed out of the <hi>Signiory</hi> and baniſhed, and the <hi>Ban</hi> of one put in print, to the publique no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of all the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:15369:64"/>
Now to that which concernes <note place="margin">4</note> the fourth Writing, which is a Decree of the Senate for the re-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the Religious fugitives, which <hi>Paul Catel</hi> ſaith hee tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed out of the Regiſter of the <hi>Pregadi,</hi> or a Court of the Senate; it is not needfull to ſay much of this matter. For it is true, that the Senate did conſent that ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious as went out of the State for the Interdict might returne, excepting onely the <hi>Ieſuites;</hi> and that ſuch Religious perſons as were gone out onely upon this occaſion might be re-eſtabliſhed, and their goods and Benefices re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored. And it is true in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that there was a releaſe of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtration made upon the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes of ſuch as were in Rome
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:15369:64"/>
or elſewhere out of the <hi>Dominion;</hi> true alſo, that that Decree of the <hi>Senate</hi> was written, and recorded in the ſecret Bookes of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of <hi>Pregadi.</hi> For not any thing of the leaſt moment is there put in deliberation, which is not firſt written and read; and being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved on, it is regiſtred in thoſe ſecret Bookes, and all this was done in that act of the <hi>Senate</hi> tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the reſtitution of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious. But theſe bookes are not ſhowne or ſeene by any perſon whatſoever, unleſſe he have part in the Government, or be a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the <hi>Senate.</hi> And if they thinke meet to publiſh any thing, it is copied out and ſigned by the hand of a Secretary onely, and of no other. But when the <hi>Senate</hi>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:15369:65"/>
deliberateth to give anſwer to an Ambaſſador or to any other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, calling him into the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, the Secretary reades it to him: And if that reading doe not ſeeme ſufficient for the memory of that Perſonage to whom it is made, the Secretary reades it over and over againe, untill he be fully ſatisfied. And this ſame forme is obſerved when the Perſon is not called into the Colledge; then a Secretarie is ſent unto him, and carying with him one leaf, which containes the reſolution of the <hi>Senate,</hi> hee reades it to him once and againe. In this manner notice was given to the <hi>Cardinall</hi> of the <hi>Senates</hi> Decree touching the reſtoring of the Religious, which happely after was commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:15369:65"/>
by the <hi>Cardinall</hi> to <hi>Paul Catel.</hi> But that he hath ſeene it in the Book, or copied it thence, that he might have it in a more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and authentique forme, this is a plaine and ſhameleſſe lie: like others of his, which are apparent by the evidence of the facts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>No diſcreet perſon ought to marvell, that the paſſages of this Treatie are vainly repreſented by divers, and that each one, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his affection, draweth things to the advantage of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which he favoureth: but every man ought to reſolve himſelfe in things that are evident, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that the truth cannot be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed: Conſidering that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdict was not obſerved for one
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:15369:66"/>
moment either in <hi>Venice,</hi> or in any place within the <hi>Dominion;</hi> that the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> doe ſtill remaine bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed out of the State; that no wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in this buſineſſe was publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by either of the parties, ſave onely one with conſent of them both; which was the revocation of the Proteſtation with Letters from the <hi>Prince</hi> directed unto the Prelates of his <hi>State,</hi> dated Aprill 21, by which any man may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend how things were under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood; that ſuch Eccleſiaſtiques as committed any great treſpaſſes after the accommodating of theſe Controverſies, were impriſoned and puniſhed; that if Churches or Religious Houſes have a deſire to purchaſe any immoveables, they muſt firſt demand Licenſe;
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:15369:66"/>
and briefly, that <hi>all the Lawes</hi> heretofore queſtioned are ſtill punctually executed and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; And informing his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by theſe evidences, he ought to reject all forged and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fait <hi>Libels,</hi> whereof as the former times have beene fruitfull and brought forth innumerable, ſo wee cannot hope but that the times to come will produce ſome ſuch like, untill <hi>our Lord enlighten all things with the glory of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing.</hi>
